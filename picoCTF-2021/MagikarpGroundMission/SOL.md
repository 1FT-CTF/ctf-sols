- Follow the instructions given, as the password changes for each user I presume
- Run a command similar to `ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 59968`, then input the given password
- Once you are logged in, run the ls command
- We find some files called 1of3.flag.txt, we should read it via `cat 1of3.flag.txt`, then read the second file via `cat instructions-to-2of3.txt`
- Keep on `cat`ing the files (and `cd`ing when neccessary), and get the flag
